# popug-frontend

A collection of reusable React UI components, by yours truly, thedevdesigner.

Right now, I am coming up with a list of simple components to add in this package.

## Usage

Run `npm i --save popug-frontend` in your project root (that contains the `package.json` file) to get started.
